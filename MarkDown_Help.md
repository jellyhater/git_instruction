# Hello, this is a file of some syntax for MD

Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

# Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (*h3*), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2	
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4	
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6


# Alternate Syntax

Heading level 1
===============	
Heading level 2
---------------  

  


# Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
I just love **bold text**.
I just love __bold text__.
Love**is**bold

# Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
A*cat*meow

# Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

This text is ***really important***.
This text is ___really important___.
This text is __*really important*__.
This text is **_really important_**.
This is really***very***important text.

* Note: The order of the em and strong tags might be reversed depending on the Markdown processor you're using.
# Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item  
---
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item
# Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item
+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

# Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
***
